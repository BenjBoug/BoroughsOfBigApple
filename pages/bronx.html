<strong>The Bronx</strong> is the borough the most of north of New York City. The Bronx is <em>county of Bronx</em>, in 2010 they were 1,385,108.
Its name comes from <em>Jonas Bronck</em>, a Swedish immigrant who was the first to colonize this area. In the past the area was designated as the <em>Rananchqua</em> by <em>the Siwanoy</em> (Native American) and the settlers called it, <em>Broncksland</em> or <em>Bronck's farm</em>, which eventually gave Bronx. The name of the borough is always accompanied by the definite article, while the name of the county is only Bronx.

Originally the land is inhabited by Siwanoy, a Native American clan, who founded several villages. The territory of the Bronx originally belonged to the Westchester County and included four cities : <em>Westchester</em>, <em>Yonkers</em>, <em>Eastchester</em> and <em>Pelham</em>. In the 19th century, the neighborhood hosts immigrantsProtestants, Catholics (Irish and Italians) an ethnic black community of Haiti and West Africa. In 1846, a new town, <em>West Farms</em> was created. Other subdivisions emerged : <em>Morrisiana</em> in 1855 (after “West Farms”) and <em>Kingsbridgein</em> 1873 (after Yonkers). In 1874, the western part of the current Bronx“(Kingsbridge”, <em>Morrisania</em> and <em> WestFarms</em>) was transferred to the County of New York, followed in 1895 in “Westchester” and some parts of <em>Eastchester</em> and “Pelham” and <em>City Island</em> in 1896.

The first subway line was installed in 1904. After annexation by the City of New York, these neighborhoods from <em>Westchester</em> in 1914 banded together to form the county of Bronx. The 1920s saw the construction of Yankee Stadium. After World War II, the renovation of several neighborhoods in Manhattan (slum clearance) causes an influx of blacks and Puerto Ricans in the neighborhood already known for its social problems. The Bronx is now one of the most delicate boroughs of New York, where various traffic sully his reputation.
